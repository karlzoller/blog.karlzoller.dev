I am a senior software engineer currently working at Amazon Web Services (AWS).
I am currently working on internal diagnostic platforms for AWS Support and have previously worked on some
public-facing products such as AWS Health, PHD, and SupportAPI.

I am passionate about solving difficult problems with software and
solving problems in the software engineering process.
